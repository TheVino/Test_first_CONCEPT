# Test First Code Later (Test-Driven Development)* 🏞️
Hi! This repo is a programming concept of test cases/ units where we first build our tests and then we write the proper code to pass the tests (other way around). 

 First we write the methods with no functionality, to make clear which test cases we need to structure.

After knowing the function we will have, we can start building the unit tests! One by One.
In this case, when the fuction "add" iss called, we will make sure to only receive numbers!
So lets code a test that will be able to raise exceptions to cover our function.

First example:

Here we cover cases like string, non-values. Sure we could go even further with *lists, files, etc.*

When running theses test, we can see the results:

Now that we have our first example results. Lets code all the other functions and their tests 🤔

With al lthe testing code done, here is the result:
